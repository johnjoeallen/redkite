# RedKite

RedKite is a local Maven dependency analyser and upgrade assistant for checked-out Java repositories.

It analyses local working copies, builds a dependency inventory, checks Maven Central for newer versions, records vulnerability findings from OSV.dev, and lets you select upgrades in the browser and generate a ready-to-apply updated POM.

## What It Does

- analyses Maven multi-module projects (dependencies, dependency management, and build plugins)
- shows declared (direct) and transitive dependencies with scope and version source
- highlights SNAPSHOT dependencies as unverified risks
- fetches and caches version metadata from Maven Central
- fetches and caches vulnerability data from OSV.dev
- recommends upgrades grouped by module with per-component version selectors
- generates an updated POM preview in-browser — all declared dependencies are normalised to `${artifactId.version}` property references, with upgraded versions set to the selected value
- keeps all data on the developer machine

## Requirements

- Java 17 or later ([download](https://adoptium.net))
- Maven 3.9+ (must be on `PATH` for dependency tree resolution)

## Install

Download the latest `red-kite-<version>.zip` from the [releases page](../../releases), then unzip it:

```bash
unzip red-kite-<version>.zip -d red-kite
cd red-kite
```

## Start The Server

```bash
./red-kite.sh
```

On Windows:

```bat
red-kite.bat
```

The server starts on port `6502` and stores its database in a `data/` subdirectory next to the JAR. Open the UI at:

```
http://localhost:6502
```

## Analyse A Repository

On the home page, type the full path to a Maven project and click **Analyse**. A progress overlay shows while the analysis runs; the browser navigates to the analysis when complete.

You can also click the **Analyse** button next to any previously-analysed project on the home page, or **Analyse** from inside an existing analysis.

## Project Page

Each project has a page showing:

- a summary of the latest analysis (component count, recommendations, status)
- an **Analysis history** list of all past analyses with timestamps and status badges — click any row to open that analysis
- an **Analyse** button to trigger a new analysis
- the resolved `settings.xml` path and configured Maven repositories

## Apply Upgrades

In the analysis, adjust target versions in the dropdowns and click **Apply selected**. RedKite runs a bracketed validation sequence:

1. Builds the project in its current state (`mvn clean install -DskipTests`)
2. Writes all POM changes to disk
3. Builds again to confirm the changes produce a working build

A progress overlay shows the current phase. If post-apply validation fails, RedKite reverts all POM changes and reports the failure with the attributed dependency where possible. If the project was already failing before apply, that is noted and the revert logic still runs.

Version upgrades normalise any literal `<version>` tag to a `${artifactId.version}` property reference and set the property value to the chosen version. Dep-management pins and exclusions are written directly into the appropriate POM.

Use **Clear cache** to flush the cached version and vulnerability metadata and force a fresh fetch on the next analysis.

## Configuration

Pass JVM system properties to override defaults:

```bash
java -Dredkite.port=8080 -jar red-kite.jar
```

| Property | Default |
|---|---|
| `redkite.port` | `6502` |
| `redkite.db.url` | `jdbc:h2:~/.redkite/redkite;MODE=PostgreSQL;DATABASE_TO_LOWER=TRUE` |
| `redkite.db.user` | `sa` |
| `redkite.db.password` | _(empty)_ |
| `redkite.prefs.file` | `~/.redkite/preferences.properties` |
| `redkite.osv.url` | `https://api.osv.dev` |
| `redkite.version.lookback` | `10` — how many older releases the version-selector dropdown offers below the current version |

## Build From Source

Requires Maven 3.9+ and Java 17.

```bash
mvn package -DskipTests
```

The fat JAR is produced at `red-kite-server/target/red-kite-<version>.jar`.

## Known Limitations

- Maven projects only.
- Local repositories only.
- No Gradle, npm, Docker, or license scanning.
